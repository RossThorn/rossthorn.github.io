             <h4> I had the pleasure of working with my brother's band, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/officiallynorthern/" target='_blank'>The Northern Lights</a>, to design
             their logo and create their website. They are some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5wptaDiu6uSRLlvx9fPIDR" target='_blank'>awesome musicians</a> and terrific people to work with! The band wanted a logo to match their vintage sound and insipiration,
           but a timeless look that is still modern and will still look cool in years to come. <br><br>
          I searched around for some classic fonts, trying several different styles before I found a perfect font at one of my favorite sites, <a href="https://www.letterheadfonts.com/" target='_blank'>Letterhead Fonts</a>.
          I created a sheet with some sample logos, which allowed us to narrow in on our collective vision for the perfect logo.
         </h4>
            </div>

          </div>

    <div class='container-fluid' align=center>
        <img style='box-shadow:0px 0px 2px gray; width:40%;' src='images\samplelogos.png' >
          </div>

          <div class='container-fluid' align=center>

           <div class='col-xs-10 description' style='padding-bottom:25px; float:none;'><br>
             <h4> We were definitely getting close with some of these, but they needed to feel a bit more emblematic. By forming an arch with the text, it really
               gave it that effect. I customized a few of the letters to make it appear more symmetrical and lo and behold, we arrived at the logo below!
         </h4>
            </div>

                </div>

          <div class='container-fluid' align=center>
              <img style='box-shadow:0px 0px 2px gray; height: 80vh; margin-top: 20px;' src='images\nlLogo.png' >

                   <h4> The distressing on the text isn't an official part of the logo, but it adds a lot on a plain background. I also enjoyed honing my PhotoShop skills and
                     overlaying the logo on different backgrounds!
               </h4>
                  </div>
                  <div class='container-fluid' align=center>
                      <img style='box-shadow:0px 0px 2px gray; height: 60vh; margin-top: 20px;' src='images\logovariations.png' >

                    <h4> The logo makes a great header for their site,
                      which was also an awesome project to work on. I rarely get to do website design, so I had fun coming up with a solution for them. They formerly had a site built with Bandzoogle, a web-design platform that is specifically geared towards
                      musicians. You can make some cool sites with it, but anything is only as good as the effort and design used to create it. Unfortunately, the guys in
                      the band had other stuff to focus on, so I made an offer to create the site from scratch.
                      <br><br>
                      I wanted to simplify their site. Originally, they had a bunch of different pages, but not a lot of content to fill each of those pages out. My friend Clay at <a href="https://strlght.com" target='_blank'>STRLGHT Media</a> showed
                      me a site called <a href="https://onepagelove.com/" target='_blank'>One Page Love</a>, a site for showcasing beautiful and simple one-page websites! This inspired me to take a similar approach and have everything
                      on a single page with different sections. This is also a great solution for mobile devices, as single page scrolling is really easy.

                      <div class='container-fluid' align=center>
                      <div class='col-xs-10 description' style='padding-bottom:25px; float:none;'><br>
                        <h4>
                          The site is live at <a href="https://thenorthernlightsmusic.com/" target='_blank'>thenorthernlightsmusic.com</a>! I coded most of the site by hand, but I used some
                          really handy widgets, such as the <a href="https://lightwidget.com/" target='_blank'>Light Widget</a>, a responsive widget for embedding an Instagram gallery in any site.
                          I also designed each section header to add some more flair to the site, but not clash with the other fonts.
                          <br><br>Overall, I think it turned out really well and I'm happy to see it work
                          for them! I often have a lot of passion projects of mine going on, but if you're interested in having me create a website for you, feel free to reach out!
