      <h4 style="margin-top:0px;">This interactive map story sheds light on the travesty of human trafficking in the United States.
        Modern day slavery affects millions of people in today's world, even in a first-world country like the US. We created this map rooted in
        emotional cartographic theory.<br><br> During the creation of this map, we collaborated with and interviewed several experts who work to
        combat human trafficking domestically and abroad. We designed this project to promote empathy and really embed the user in the mapping story,
        showing that human trafficking occurs where they are.<br><br>I encourage you to take some time and explore the project below, as it is a great
        resource for learning more about the worldwide crime. It is much more than just a portfolio piece.<br><br>
        Collaborators: <a href="https://leanneabraham.github.io" target="_blank">Leanne Abraham</a> & <a href="https://aliciaaiverson.github.io" target="_blank">Alicia Iverson</a>
