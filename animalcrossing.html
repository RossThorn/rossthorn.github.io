        <h4>In March 2020, Nintendo released the latest installment in the Animal Crossing video game series, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>! 
          I was a big fan of this series when I was playing it on my Nintendo DS 15 years ago and was very excited to get the game! I had been working on publishing <a href="interactivefantasymaps.html">some interactive fantasy maps</a> 
          and told myself that I couldn't get this game until they were done.
        <br><br>
        Once I released the maps and rewarded myself with the game, I thought it would be cool to create an interactive map for my island in the game! I had been playing around with some 3D extrusions in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> 
        which would be perfect for representing the tiered topography in Animal Crossing!</h4>

      <h4>First, I grabbed a screenshot from the game and brought it into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> to give it some coordinates. That way, when I digitize the boundaries, 
        Mapbox can actually place them somewhere on the Earth's surface so it can render it. Once I had all the features digitized, I could upload it as a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/">vector tileset</a> 
        to create a web map! I traced the landmass, waterbodies, infrastructure, and other geographical features and it was ready to go. One of the things I had to keep in mind that with the default Mapbox styling, I wouldn't be able to get the 
        iconic appearance of the tiered topography with a tan cliff and a green, grassy surface. This is because

      <h4>One of the things I had to keep in mind was that with the default Mapbox styling, I wouldn't be able to get the 
        iconic appearance of the tiered topography with a tan cliff and a green, grassy surface. This is because extruded features in Mapbox only allow for a single color for the entirety of the polygon. My workaround was to create a very small buffer 
        on all of the plateaus so that I could style that to look like a shear cliff face. I also added a seamless SVG texture to the grass to replicate the iconic pattern from the actual game.
        <br><br>
        This was a super fun project to work on, both topically and because I learned a bit more about dealing with three-dimensional visualization in Mapbox. 
        I hope to add more to it in the future, maybe including fruit tree locations and 3D buildings. You can interact with the map <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redgiantmaps.com/maps/krunkel">here</a>!
