        <h4>I was approached by some musicians to create a logo and branding for a podcast they wanted to start. I was thrilled for the opportunity to sharpen some more graphic design
          skills and asked them some more details to help me envision something that would work for them. The podcast was to be called <strong>The Offbeat</strong> and intended 
          as a place for musicians and other creative folks to discuss their journeys and endeavors. Additionally, they wanted the branding colors to be a deep red and black (as they already
          bought some of the backdrop for filming videos).
        <br><br>
        With these requests, I started mentally workshopping ideas. The context of musicians and "beat" in the title inspired me to incorporate some sort of drum into the logo. I went 
        with a modern, geometric sans-serif font and before long I had the working logo!</h4>

        <h4>Once I had the basic idea for the logo, I wanted to make a few variations along with some frames and other 
        graphics so the clients could see some options as well as how the logo could fit into different promotional content. In my logo variations, 
        I provided some options where the words in logo were rearranged to fit multiple aspect ratios and some versions with and without accent colors.

        <h4>I also created an "episode image" frame incorporated their branding colors to highlight the guest on the latest podcast. An image of the guest would still need 
          to be the focal point, but the clients wanted a recognizable and branded frame for social media and promotion. I included some variations in the brightness of the colors to 
          add a little more contrast, as well as the "b" from the logo up in the corner to sort of act as an emblem for their brand.

        <h4>After I had the idea to create that emblem, I thought it might be helpful to create some variations of it focused on social media and the round profile pictures. I 
          included light, dark, and gradient background options to give them a basic range of options and also allow them to have the flexibility to change it to keep things fresh.
