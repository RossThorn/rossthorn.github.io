        <h4>After creating <a href="fantasy.html">a fantasy map</a> for a D&D campaign I was playing in, I wanted to try to take our map experience
        to another level. We had a physical map that I had printed for our Dungeon Master, but I thought it would be cool to make an interactive version of it
        so my friends and I could pull it up on our phones or laptops to reference during a session.
        <br><br>
        I decided to use <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> to accomplish my goal. I made a less stylized version of the map designed for print
        and brought it into <a href="https://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> (my mapping software) to apply some coordinates to the image so the web mapping software
        could recognize it and put it on earth. This allowed me to create a georeferenced raster, much like satellite imagery, which isn't much more than
        pictures with coordinates that allow you to place them in the correct location. I also created a geoJSON file for all the cities and points of interest to add those to the map and allow for 
        popups with more information about the locations. I created a raster <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/tilesets/">tileset</a> from the georeferenced map 
        and a <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/styles/">style</a> to reference in a web page. With a little web development,<strong><i> I created my
        first interactive fantasy map!</i></strong></h4>

        <h4>I was thrilled that I got it to work the way I wanted. However, I wasn't pleased with the overall map aesthetic and the lack of flexibility with the colors
          and other style choices. Luckily, <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/">vector tiles</a> exist and allow for exactly what I was missing. 
          I began the long process of digitizing the landmass in QGIS and created my first vector tileset and style with my new data! Along with the landmass,
          I digitized different landcover and bathymetry (water depth) that gave the map some good visual contrast. I also wanted a nicer 
          popup instead of the default white background, so I created an image that looked similar to parchment paper and set that as the popup background. And with those changes,
          my interactive map for my D&D group was complete.

          <h4>I continued to play around with settings and styles in this map. I added more data like roads and more functionality like a measure tool (at the request of my Dungeon Master). 
            As I worked, I began to believe that other people could find these maps useful too. <br><br> Maps are already great tools for helping to immerse the user in the landscape being depicted. 
            This is especially true and arguably more important for maps of imaginary places, since the user cannot actually go there; a map acts as a sort of bridge to bring your mind closer to the fantasy world you're 
            reading about or playing a game in. I talk about this in <a href="bit.ly/RTthesis">my thesis</a> if you want to find out more about that. But basically, when you engage in a roleplaying
            game you assume multiple identities (or at least you do according to researcher 
            <a href="https://blog.ufes.br/kyriafinardi/files/2017/10/What-Video-Games-Have-to-Teach-us-About-Learning-and-Literacy-2003.-ilovepdf-compressed.pdf">James Paul Gee</a> (see chapter 3):<br><br><ul>
              <li>The identity of the character you're playing, or your <strong><i>virtual identity</i></strong></li>
              <li>Your personal identity in the real world, or your <strong><i>real identity</i></strong></li>
              <li>A hybrid identity between you and the character, or your <strong><i>projective identity</i></strong></li>
            </ul><br>
            A map can serve each of these identities in different ways, but in the end, I'd argue that an interactive map might be one of the best ways 
            to support immersion in a fantasy world.
